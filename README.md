Controlling a Sphero BB-8 with WebBluetooth


## What do I need?

- [Sphero BB-8 App-Enabled Droid](https://www.sphero.com/bb-8-app-enabled-droid)
- A browser that support WebBluetooth on your operating system

Try it out at: https://bluetooth.rocks/bb8

Even if you don't have any of the items above, you can still check it out in emulation mode. 


## How does this work?

The browser can connect to a Bluetooth LE device like the Spherio BB-8 Droid. Each Bluetooth device has a number of services and characteristics. Think of them like objects with properties. Once connected to the device, the API then exposes these services and characteristics and you can read from and write to those characteristics. 

The BB-8 Droid exposes a number of functions including the ability to drive a little motor inside of the body of BB-8.


## Why??

Because it's fun.
